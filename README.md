# Redirection Handler

A simple, elegant, and secure redirection page designed to bypass LinkedIn's
spam filters for `.pages.dev` domains and other URLs. This tool allows you to
share your portfolio or other links on platforms like LinkedIn without them
being flagged, by using a trusted intermediary domain (like GitHub Pages) and a
secure ID-based redirection mechanism.
